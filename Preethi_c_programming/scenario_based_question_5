// Design a C program to find the eligibility of admission for a professional course  based on the following criteria:
        Eligibility Criteria       
       Marks in Maths>=65 and Marks in Phy>=55 and 
       Marks in Chem>=50  and Total in all three subject >=190 
Total in Maths and Physics >=140

#include <stdio.h>

    int math, phy, chem, total, math_phy_total;
